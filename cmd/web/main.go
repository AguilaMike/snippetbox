	// flag will be stored in the addr variable at runtime.
	addr := flag.String("addr", ":4000", "HTTP network address")

	// Importantly, we use the flag.Parse() function to parse the command-line flag.
	// This reads in the command-line flag value and assigns it to the addr
	// variable. You need to call this *before* you use the addr variable
	// otherwise it will always contain the default value of ":4000". If any errors are
	// encountered during parsing the application will be terminated.
	flag.Parse()

	// writes to the standard out stream and uses the default settings.

	// The value returned from the flag.String() function is a pointer to the flag
	// value, not the value itself. So in this code, that means the addr variable
	// is actually a pointer, and we need to dereference it (i.e. prefix it with
	// the * symbol) before using it. Note that we're using the log.Printf()
	// function to interpolate the address with the log message.
	// log.Printf("starting server on %s", *addr)
	// Use the Info() method to log the starting server message at Info severity
	// (along with the listen address as an attribute).
	logger.Info("starting server", "addr", *addr)

	// And we pass the dereferenced addr pointer to http.ListenAndServe() too.
	err := http.ListenAndServe(*addr, app.routes())
	//log.Fatal(err)
	// And we also use the Error() method to log any error message returned by
	// http.ListenAndServe() at Error severity (with no additional attributes),
	// and then call os.Exit(1) to terminate the application with exit code 1.
	logger.Error(err.Error())
	os.Exit(1)
